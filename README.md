# house_price_predictor
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a simple linear regression model that predicts house prices based solely on square footage. It serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning and regression analysis for beginners.
Features

Simple one-variable linear regression implementation
Data generation for practice (can be replaced with real data)
Exploratory data analysis and visualization
Model training and evaluation
Visual comparison of predictions vs actual data
Interactive price prediction function
Comprehensive analysis of model limitations

Requirements

Python 3.6+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn

How It Works

Data Generation/Import: Creates synthetic housing data (or import your own data)
Data Exploration: Visualizes the relationship between square footage and price
Model Training: Fits a linear regression model to the training data
Evaluation: Calculates performance metrics (RMSE and R²)
Prediction: Provides a function to predict prices for new square footage values

Example Output
CopyModel Performance:
Training RMSE: $45210.36
Testing RMSE: $46985.88
Training R²: 0.8932
Testing R²: 0.8874

Model Coefficients:
Intercept: $14256.73
Coefficient (price per sq ft): $146.82

Example Predictions:
Estimated price for 1000 sq ft home: $161076.98
Estimated price for 1500 sq ft home: $234486.12
Estimated price for 2000 sq ft home: $307895.26
Estimated price for 2500 sq ft home: $381304.40
Estimated price for 3000 sq ft home: $454713.54
Extending the Project
This simple model can be extended in several ways:

Use real housing data from your local market
Add more features (bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc.)
Try different regression techniques
Create a web interface for predictions
